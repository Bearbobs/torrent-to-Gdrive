### Tutorial
Click the badge which says 'Open in Colab' and follow directions there.

### What is the purpose of it?
1. Because of Google Servers speed, I downloaded 12GB of file and the average speed was 60MBPS.
2. Because it is in the cloud, by that I mean I can access it anywhere on my phone, tablet or etc without copying file to all of them.
